# Learning STEM

[**What's Tor?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) Software that helps you browse the internet anonymously (almost).
[**What's stem?**](https://stem.torproject.org/index.html) Python library to interact with Tor.

## Motivation
When I got started with stem, I was just a fresh, out-of-college graduate. I found stem interesting, but the API was tough to understand and there weren't many resources that taught how to use stem. There aren't many today. This project aims to work as a starting point for people who want to do interesting things with Tor.

## Setup Used
* Python 3.6 (inside a virtualenv)
* Ubuntu 18.04 Operating System
* Tor version - 0.4.2.7 (git-74cad14699087b7e) (USE LATEST)

## Disclaimer
* Examples in this tutorial are not bullet proof and are just for learning purpose. They should never be directly used in the production code.
* Some examples might work differently in a Windows setup.
