# Learning STEM

[**What's Tor?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) Software that helps you browse the internet anonymously (almost). <br>
[**What's stem?**](https://stem.torproject.org/index.html) Python library to interact with Tor.

## Motivation
When I got started with stem, I was just a fresh, out-of-college graduate. I found stem interesting, but the API docs were tough to understand at first and there weren't many resources that helped. 

There aren't many today, but now I am able to realize how well written the API docs are. This project aims to work as a starting point for people who want to do interesting things with Tor but are initmidated by stem's docs.

## Setup Used
* Python 3.6 (inside a virtualenv)
* Ubuntu 18.04 Operating System
* Tor version - 0.4.2.7 (git-74cad14699087b7e) (USE LATEST)

## Disclaimer
* Examples in this tutorial are not bullet proof and are just for learning purpose. They should never be directly used in the production code.

* Some examples might work differently in a Windows setup.
